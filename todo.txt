Handling naming stuff:
    - Have a file with valid names
    - If the DAT file being loaded doesn't match the filenames in validFileNames folder, specify a conflict and add a popup for resolving the conflict. 
        - The popup will:
            1) Display one of the problem files
            2) Have the user specify a character and color that they want to replace
            3) The DAT file will be renamed to the correct name via some sort of map. 
            4) Iterate, starting with the next problem file. 
Edge case: There's a subfolder. Need to traverse till you find the dat files
    - Also shouldn't try importing if no dat files were found
Better indication that you pressed the import button
